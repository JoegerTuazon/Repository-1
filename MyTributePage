        <h2><br>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:<br></h2>
  
        <ul>
          <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>

          <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br>
             to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li><br>

          <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps,
             helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>

          <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li><br>

          <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by
          Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>

          <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead,
          the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. </li><br>

          <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li><br>

          <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to
          Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
          strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>

          <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields </li><br>

          <li>1953 - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating
          a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>

          <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br>
          subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population.</li><br>

          <li>1970 - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>

          <li>1983 - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields </li><br>

          <li>1984 - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li><br>

          <li>2005 - States "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically
          modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM
          crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals 
          for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </li><br>

          <li>2009 - Dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
        </ul>
